      Rain On Me
      Ariana Grande, Lady Gaga

      I didn't ask for a free ride
      I only asked you to show me a real good time
      I never asked for the rainfall
      At least I showed up, you showed me nothing at all
      It's coming down on me
      Water like misery
      It's coming down on me
      I'm ready, rain on me
      I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
      Rain on me, rain, rain
      Rain on me, rain, rain
      I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
      Rain on me, rain, rain
      Rain on me
      Rain on me
      Mmm, oh yeah, baby
      Rain on me
      Living in a world where no one's innocent
      Oh, but at least we try
      Gotta live my truth, not keep it bottled in
      So I don't lose my mind
      Baby, yeah
      I can feel it on my skin
      It's coming down on me
      Teardrops on my face
      Water like misery
      Let it wash away my sins
      It's coming down on me
      Let it wash away
